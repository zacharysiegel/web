                <h3>Singularity</h3>
                <p>
                    <i>A game of production and diplomacy</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have recently begun work on a multiplayer, social RTS game. The game is designed to facilitate organic,
                    complex social interactions between players as each vies for supremacy over the others. Taking inspiration from
                    <a href="http://subterfuge-game.com/">Subterfuge</a>,
                    though the game occurs in "real time", the rate of time progression is slow enough to allow strategies and
                    alliances to develop over the course of days or weeks. Players may tactically engage opponents in violent
                    conflict, but they must also carefully develop resouces and chains. This element of the game utilizes
                    factory-building mechanics to allow players to specialize production to suit their specific geographic, social,
                    or military needs. Thus, the realms of military and economy are blurred, fortifying bonds between players and
                    intensifying every decision.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For those interested, the game is implemented using Rust for both the server and client. Due to the game's
                    genre, the primary target platforms are iOS and Android systems, though I expect to support PC clients as well.

                <h3>Secr</h3>
                <p>
                    A minimal secret manager around structured ciphertext files. This tool enables me to very easily store all 
                    secrets for a project within a single file, encrypted with a single master key. <em>Secr</em> provides 
                    interfaces for humans via the command line or programs via a Rust library.

                <h3>Bacter</h3>
                <p>
                    Bacter is a multiplayer, arena combat web game I created in high school.<br/>
                    I have put in a small effort to revive the game's server at this subdomain:
                    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bacter.zach.ro">bacter.zach.ro</a>.<br/>
                    This project is a special kind of garbage. I think it's fun, but don't expect it to perform well.
