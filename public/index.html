            <h3>Bacter</h3>
            <p>
                Bacter is a multiplayer, arena combat web game I created in high school.<br/>
                I have put in a small effort to revive the game's server at this subdomain:
                <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bacter.zach.ro">bacter.zach.ro</a>.<br/>
                This project is a special kind of garbage. I think it's fun, but don't expect it to perform well.

            <h3>Singularity</h3>
            <p>
                <i>A game of production and diplomacy</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                I have recently begun work on a multiplayer, social RTS game. The game is designed to facilitate organic,
                complex social interactions between players as each vies for supremacy over the others. Taking inspiration from
                <a href="http://subterfuge-game.com/">Subterfuge</a>,
                though the game occurs in "real time", the rate of time progression is slow enough to allow strategies and
                alliances to develop over the course of days or weeks. Players may tactically engage opponents in violent
                conflict, but they must also carefully develop resouces and chains. This element of the game utilizes
                factory-building mechanics to allow players to specialize production to suit their specific geographic, social,
                or military needs. Thus, the realms of military and economy are blurred, fortifying bonds between players and
                intensifying every decision.
